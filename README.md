This program keeps track of students and their GPAs using two parallel arrays and some basic pointer work. I used const and references where I didn't want values to be changed by accident, and pointers let me update GPAs directly. The program runs in a loop with a menu using a do-while and switch statement, so you can keep adding students, updating GPAs, printing the list, or checking the average until you quit. I threw exceptions when the list was full or when trying to get an average with no students, and caught them in main() to print a simple error message. I also used static_cast<int> to show the average GPA as a rounded number, adn made sure to free all the memory for the names at the end.
